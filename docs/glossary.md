# ðŸ’¡ Glossary

Take a look at the [live demo](https://johku.org) and the [database schema](../app/prisma/schema.prisma), it will give a good idea of what will be written here next. With that out of the way, this portfolio consists of the following types of data:

## Maintainer

This is data about the person who is maintaining the portfolio. This will contain things like a profile pic, name, headline and a short biography.

## Projects

Like the name suggests, this is the data that represents any projects that you have been working on. You can showcase videos and images. The text portion is markdown so remember to utilize that syntax as well.

## Achievements

This data represents professional experience. Got promoted or started at a new position? This is the thing for you.

## Highlight

If you would like to let people know about some cool event or some other notable thing that happened, this one is what you're looking for.

## Skills

To showcase all the things you can do, use this. It will store just the name and an icon to keep it short and sweet.
