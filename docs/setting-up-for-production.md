## üè≠ Setting up for production

### Prerequisites

- Running instance of Ubuntu server.
- Static IP address assigned to that instance.
- Domain name with records pointing to the static IP address.
- Ports for HTTP (80), HTTPS (443) and adminer (8080) open on that instance.

### Steps

1. Connect to your instance and run [this initialization script](../init-ubuntu.sh) with sudo privileges.
2. Fill in any details required while running this script. The script will ask for following input:
   - Permission for installing docker and compose (y/n).
   - Credentials for a new portfolio user.
   - Details for generating SSL certificates ([Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/)).
3. Switch over to the new portfolio user `sudo su portfolio` and navigate to `/home/portfolio`.
4. Open the .env file with your favorite text editor and fill in the environment variables by following the [example here](environment-variables.md).
5. Run the portfolio with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up`.
6. Connect to the app container and initialize the database by following [these instructions](database-and-migrations.md#Initialization).
7. If everything has been set up correctly, the portfolio should now be up and running on your domain.
